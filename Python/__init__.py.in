ViennaRay
========

ViennaRay is a flux calculation library for topography simulations, based on
IntelÂ®'s ray tracing kernel [Embree](https://www.embree.org/). It is designed
to provide efficient and high-performance ray tracing, while maintaining a
simple and easy to use interface. ViennaRay was developed and optimized for
use in conjunction with [ViennaLS](https://github.com/ViennaTools/ViennaLS),
which provides the necessary geometry representation. It is however possible
to use this as a standalone library, with self-designed geometries.
