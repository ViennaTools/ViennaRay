    "content": "Top-Down Flux Calculation Library . Get started now View it on GitHub . ViennaRay is a flux calculation library for topography simulations, based in Intel®’s ray tracing kernel Embree. It is designed to provide efficient and high-performance ray tracing, while maintaining a simple and easy to use interface. ViennaRay was developed and optimized for use in conjunction with ViennaLS, which provides the necessary geometry representation. It is however possible to use this as a standalone library, with self-designed geometries. ViennaRay is under heavy development and improved daily. If you do have suggestions or find bugs, please let us know on GitHub or contact us directly at viennatools@iue.tuwien.ac.at! . ",
