# ViennaRay
{: .fs-10 }

Top-Down Flux Calculation Library
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

---

ViennaRay stands as a dedicated flux calculation library tailored for topography simulations, leveraging IntelÂ®'s powerful ray tracing kernel, [Embree](https://www.embree.org/). Crafted with a focus on delivering efficient and high-performance ray tracing capabilities, ViennaRay maintains a user-friendly interface for seamless integration into various applications. While specifically optimized for synergy with [ViennaLS](https://github.com/ViennaTools/ViennaLS), where it complements the essential geometry representation, ViennaRay is versatile enough to function independently. Users have the flexibility to employ it as a standalone library, accommodating custom geometries for diverse simulation needs.
