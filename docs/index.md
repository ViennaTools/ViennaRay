# ViennaRay
{: .fs-10 }

Top-Down Flux Calculation Library
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

---

ViennaRay is a flux calculation library for topography simulations, based in IntelÂ®'s ray tracing kernel [Embree](https://www.embree.org/). It is designed to provide efficient and high-performance ray tracing, while maintaining a simple and easy to use interface. ViennaRay was developed and optimized for use in conjunction with [ViennaLS](https://github.com/ViennaTools/ViennaLS), which provides the necessary geometry representation. It is however possible to use this as a standalone library, with self-designed geometries.
