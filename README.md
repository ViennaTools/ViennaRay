ViennaRay is a flux calculation library for topography simulations, based in IntelÂ®'s ray tracing kernel [Embree](https://www.embree.org/). It is designed to provide efficient and high-performance ray tracing, while maintaining a simple and easy to use interface. ViennaRay was developed and optimized for use in conjunction with [ViennaLS](https://github.com/ViennaTools/ViennaLS), which provides the necessary geometry representation. It is however possible to use this as a standalone library, with self-designed geometries.

> [!NOTE]
> ViennaRay is under heavy development and improved daily. If you do have suggestions or find bugs, please let us know!

## Support

[Examples](examples/) can be found on Github. Bug reports and suggestions should be filed on GitHub.

## Releases

Releases are tagged on the main branch and available in the [releases section](https://github.com/ViennaTools/ViennaRay/releases).

## Building

### Supported Operating Systems

* Windows (Visual Studio)

* Linux (g++ / clang)

* macOS (XCode)

### System Requirements

* C++17 Compiler with OpenMP support

### Dependencies (installed automatically)

* [Embree](https://github.com/embree/embree)

Since [Embree](https://www.embree.org/) is optimized for CPU's using SSE, AVX, AVX2, and AVX-512 instructions, it requires at least a x86 CPU with support for SSE2 or an Apple M1 CPU.

## Installing 

Since this is a header only project, it does not require any installation. However, we recommend the following procedure in order to set up all dependencies correctly:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ViennaTools/ViennaRay.git
cd ViennaRay

cmake -B build -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/your/custom/install/
cmake --build build
cmake --install build
```

This will install the necessary headers and CMake files to the specified path. If `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` is not specified, it will be installed to the standard path for your system, usually `/usr/local/`.

## Integration in CMake projects

We recommend using [CPM.cmake](https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake) to consume this library.

* Installation with CPM

  ```cmake
  CPMAddPackage("gh:viennatools/viennaray@2.1.1")
  ```

* With a local installation
  >  In case you have ViennaRay installed in a custom directory, make sure to properly specify the `CMAKE_MODULE_PATH` or `PATHS` in your find_package call.

  ```cmake
  set(VIENNARAY_PATH "/your/local/installation")

  find_package(TBB    REQUIRED)
  find_package(OpenMP REQUIRED)

  find_package(embree 4    PATHS ${VIENNARAY_PATH})
  find_package(ViennaRay   PATHS ${VIENNARAY_PATH})

  target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} PUBLIC ViennaTools::ViennaRay)
  ```

### Building examples

The examples can be built using CMake:

```bash
cmake -B build -DVIENNARAY_BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON
cmake --build build
```

### Running the Tests

ViennaRay uses CTest to run its tests.
In order to check whether ViennaRay runs without issues on your system, you can run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ViennaTools/ViennaRay.git
cd ViennaRay

cmake -B build -DVIENNARAY_BUILD_TESTS=ON
cmake --build build
ctest --test-dir build
```
